## Data Science Tech Stack

**1. Python**
- A general-purpose programming language that's widely used in data science due to its simplicity and powerful libraries.

**2. Jupyter Notebooks**
- An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- Useful for data cleaning, transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, and machine learning.

**3. NumPy and Pandas**
- NumPy is used for numerical computations and handling arrays.
- Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data.

**4. Matplotlib and Seaborn**
- Matplotlib is a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- Seaborn is based on Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

**5. Scikit-learn**
- A machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
- It features various classification, regression, clustering algorithms, and efficient tools for model evaluation.

**6. TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for Deep Learning**
- TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence.
- Keras is an interface for TensorFlow. It's an easy-to-use tool for building neural networks.
- PyTorch is another open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, and it's used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.

**7. Git/GitHub**
- Version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It's designed for coordinating work among programmers.
- GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.

**8. Docker**
- An open-source platform used for developing, shipping, and running applications inside lightweight containers.
- It helps to ensure that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment.

**9. SQL/NoSQL Databases**
- SQL databases are used for structured data and support complex queries.
- NoSQL databases are used for unstructured data and are known for their scalability and flexibility.

**10. Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)**
- Provide a range of services like compute power, storage options, and machine learning applications, which can scale as per requirements.
- Helpful for deploying models and handling large-scale data.

**11. MLflow**
- An open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.
- It has three main components: tracking, projects, and models. It helps in keeping track of experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing predictive models.

This tech stack provides a robust, flexible, and scalable infrastructure for executing the data science pipeline effectively. While other tools can also be used based on specific requirements, this combination is popular due to the strong community support, extensive documentation, and ease of use.
