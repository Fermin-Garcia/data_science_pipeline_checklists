## Model Evaluation

**1. Evaluate Models on Test Data**
- Use your trained models to make predictions on your test data.
- Be careful not to let any information from your test set leak into your model training process.

**2. Calculate Evaluation Metrics**
- Based on the problem type, calculate appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC, MSE, RMSE, etc.).
- Understand the trade-offs between different metrics (e.g., precision vs. recall).

**3. Compare Models**
- Compare the performance of different models and different model configurations.
- Consider both the evaluation metrics and other factors, like training time or model complexity.

**4. Check for Overfitting**
- Compare the performance of your models on the training data and the test data.
- If a model performs well on the training data but poorly on the test data, it may be overfitting.

**5. Validate Model Assumptions**
- For certain algorithms (like linear regression), check whether the assumptions of the model hold true.
- If they don't, you might need to reconsider your model choice or transform your data.

**6. Error Analysis**
- Look at the specific examples your model is getting wrong.
- This could provide insight into what your model is missing and how you might improve it.


## Model Evaluation Metrics

### Classification Metrics

**1. Accuracy**
- The ratio of correct predictions to total predictions.
- Not useful if the classes are imbalanced.

**2. Precision (Positive Predictive Value)**
- Of the samples predicted as positive, how many are actually positive?
- Important when the cost of False Positives is high.

**3. Recall (Sensitivity)**
- Of all the actual positive samples, how many did we predict as positive?
- Important when the cost of False Negatives is high.

**4. F1-Score**
- The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
- Useful when you want to balance Precision and Recall.

**5. Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)**
- The probability that a random positive sample will be ranked higher than a random negative sample.
- Useful for evaluating binary classification models.

**6. Log Loss**
- For binary classification, it's the negative average of the log of the predicted probabilities for the actual classes.
- Suitable for multiclass classification and provides a more nuanced view than accuracy.

### Regression Metrics

**1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- The average of the absolute differences between predictions and actual values.
- Gives an idea of how wrong the predictions were.

**2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- The average of the squared differences between predictions and actual values.
- More popular than MAE because it "punishes" larger errors.

**3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- The square root of the Mean Squared Error.
- Even more popular than MSE because it's interpretable in the "y" units.

**4. R-Squared (Coefficient of Determination)**
- Proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).
- Provides a measure of how well future samples are likely to be predicted by the model.

### Clustering Metrics

**1. Silhouette Coefficient**
- Measure of how close each sample in one cluster is to the samples in the neighboring clusters.
- Useful for assessing the validity of the clustering output.

**2. Davies-Bouldin Index**
- The average similarity measure of each
