## Model Building

**1. Select Algorithms**
- Based on the problem type (classification, regression, clustering, etc.), select a few algorithms to start with.
- Consider the nature of your data and the assumptions of the algorithms.

**2. Set Up Cross-Validation**
- Decide on a cross-validation strategy (k-fold, stratified, etc.).
- Implement the cross-validation setup.

**3. Train Models**
- Train your selected models on the training data.
- Make sure to fit the models within the cross-validation loop, if you're using one.

**4. Tune Hyperparameters**
- Use grid search, random search, or more advanced methods to find the best hyperparameters for your models.
- Fit the models with the tuned hyperparameters.

**5. Ensemble Methods**
- Consider whether using ensemble methods (bagging, boosting, stacking) could improve your results.
- If so, train the ensemble models.

**6. Feature Importance**
- Depending on the model used, extract feature importance to understand which features are driving the model predictions.
