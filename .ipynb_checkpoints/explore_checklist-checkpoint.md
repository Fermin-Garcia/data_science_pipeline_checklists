## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**1. Analyze Distributions of Variables**
- Use descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) to understand the central tendency and spread of your variables.
- Plot histograms or boxplots to visualize these distributions.

**2. Check for Correlations**
- Calculate correlations between numeric variables.
- Visualize these correlations using a heatmap or scatterplot.

**3. Analyze Relationships between Variables**
- Identify important relationships between variables.
- This might involve grouping the data and calculating aggregate statistics, or creating pivot tables.

**4. Conduct Statistical Tests**
- Depending on your data and the nature of your project, you might need to conduct statistical tests (t-tests, chi-square tests, etc.) to understand your data better.

**5. Document and Communicate Findings**
- Keep track of what you've learned, including any surprising relationships or outliers.
- Share your findings with your team or stakeholders to get their input.
