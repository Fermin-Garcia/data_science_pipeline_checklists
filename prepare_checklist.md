## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

**1. Handle Missing Data**
- Determine how much missing data there is for each column.
- Decide on an approach for handling missing data:
    - Remove rows with missing data.
    - Impute missing values using a statistical method (mean, median, mode etc.).
    - Use algorithms that can handle missing data.

**2. Handle Outliers**
- Identify outliers in the data.
- Decide how to handle these outliers:
    - Remove them.
    - Transform them.
    - Keep them if they're valid values.

**3. Convert Data Types**
- Check the current data types of all columns.
- Convert data types if necessary (e.g. 'object' to 'category' for pandas DataFrame, 'string' to 'integer', etc.).

**4. Normalize/Standardize Data**
- Decide whether your algorithms would benefit from data normalization or standardization.
- Implement these transformations as needed.

**5. Feature Engineering**
- Based on your understanding of the problem and the data, create new features that might help improve model performance.
- Consider techniques like binning, polynomial features, or interaction features.

**6. Encoding Categorical Variables**
- Identify categorical variables in your data.
- Choose an appropriate encoding method (One-Hot, Label Encoding, etc.).

**7. Split the Data**
- Split the data into training and test sets for machine learning.
- You might also create a validation set or use cross-validation.
